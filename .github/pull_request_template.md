## ReadMe

If you are wanting to submit a PR, there's a couple of things for you to note:

* I'm currently refactoring the entire codebase to reduce technical debt and make unit tests easier to write.

* I'm currently in the process of reviewing over all my depedencies' licenses and am determining if they are compatible with my project's current license. If they are not, I may change the license of the project, and would have to ask if you're okay with submitting a PR to a different license.

* Generative AI and LLMs are not allowed at all for any submission to this repo. This includes but is not limited to, Github Copilot, ChatGPT, Midjourney, or any other generative AI. This is both because of the issues with copyrightability of code and data as well as for moral reasons. This also ensures the engine is clean so I don't have to mark the engine as using generative AI on Itch.io as per https://itch.io/docs/creators/quality-guidelines#ai-disclosure

After I finish the above two tasks, I'll be editing/removing this message.
